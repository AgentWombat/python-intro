# python-intro
A workshop for the SDSU AI club

This demo will walk you through how to code a simple program using stock Python (i.e. no external packages).

python_script.py contains a basic introduction to Python.

math_helper.py is a demo program which uses the basic concepts covered in intro.py.

To launch a Python program from the command line, follow these steps:

1) Launch your command line. 

	-- On Windows 10, press the "Windows-key" + "s", type "command prompt" then press "enter".

	-- On Mac, search your programs for "Terminal".

2) Navigate to the directory which contains your Python script.

	-- On Windows 10 and Mac, the command "cd FILEPATH" navigates to "FILEPATH".

	Ex: "cd C:\Users\Kenneth\Desktop\CS\AiClub"

3) Launch the Python script by typing "py FILENAME".

	-- If "py" does not work, try "python" and "python3".

	Ex: "py math_helper.py"
